![Figma webpage design] <img width="573" alt= Figma webpage design src="https://github.com/ivykwann/web-app-prototype/assets/128759669/6b3163e4-42f0-4c3b-b641-fcff20a6ab04">

Through my development process, I decided to slightly change the layout of my webpage - instead of having two coloumns for the 'order' section, as I was coding I found that I was able to fit all the labels and input into one column and it is probably easier for users to follow as they can just input their information straight down. 

All of the input fields from my Figma design remain the same.

What could be done better:

I tried adding in a modal when a user clicks delete on their order, where a popup will show 'Delete this order? Options - Cancel/Delete' however the code I implemented did not properly work so I decided to leave it out. I think having a delete modal would be a good idea as it can be used to prompt the user for confirmation before actually deleting something which is a good way to avoid accidental deletions.

I struggled in the dynamic input for 'toppings' when I saved my order with multiple toppings, only one would appear in the order.


Another thing that could be done better is displaying the logo of the store name or having the option for users to upload pictures of their order. 

The CSS could be improved for the header, making the logo name clearer to see.
